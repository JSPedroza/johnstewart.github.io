				Dearest Mahal,
			</span>

			<p id="message" style="font-size: 13px;">
				First of all, when I met you and you responded, it felt like one of the greatest moments of my life, Mahal.<br>
Talking to you felt like I had finally found my soulmate. Every conversation brought me joy and helped me escape my sadness. Now that I have this chance, I want to make things right.<br>
<br>
I’m truly sorry for the things I said. I know I acted immaturely and hurt you deeply. Hearing your honest feelings has shown me how much I messed up. I want to know you better because when I heard your voice and your stories about how you grew up, how you dealt with your past relationship, your journey into science research, and how hard you studied to become a pilot, I saw how special you are. I really admire your dedication and hard work. It feels unreal that someone as amazing as you actually noticed me and likes me back. It’s just so amazing from my side.<br>
<br>
You are the sweetest, most caring, and thoughtful person I’ve ever met, and it breaks my heart to think I might have lost a one-in-a-million chance with you.<br>
<br>
I was shocked when you asked me to ride a plane with you—something I never expected. You made me see how life should be, full of adventure. I want to share all the wonderful plans I have for us, like hiking and spending days at the beach, watching the sunset together. A picnic on the beach sounds perfect, and when you mentioned it, my heart filled with happiness.<br>
<br>
I want to fight for us, and I hope you can accept my apology. If you’re open to it, I’d love to spend time with you and show you how much you mean to me. I realize I was wrong in not seeing how my words affected you, and I want to help you heal.<br>
<br>
Thank you for being patient and kind with me, Mahal. I hope we can find a way forward together because losing you would be my greatest regret.<br>

				Love, <br>
				The one from your stories, JSP.
